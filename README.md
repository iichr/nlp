# Named Entity Recognition Project
## Natural Language Processing

The main file is ner.py


Call this method to run NER using own supplied training and test data
------
```python
namedentityrecognition(taggedpath,untaggedpath)
```
------
where:
	taggedpath = the path with the tagged (training) data.
	untaggedpath = the path with the untagged (test) data, which to perform NER on.


PLEASE NOTE THAT CERTAIN PATHS MAY HAVE TO BE RECONFIGURED IN ORDER FOR ner.py TO WORK PROPERLY.
FOR EXAMPLE: the location of honorifics


More information on the code can be found in the docstrings in the ner.py file.
For an in-depth analysis and description of the techniques used, refer to the [Report] file.
