The main file is ner.py


The following method is to be called for other runs:

------
namedentityrecognition(taggedpath,untaggedpath)
------
where:
	taggedpath = the path with the tagged (training) data.
	untaggedpath = the path with the untagged (test) data, which to perform NER on.


CERTAIN PATHS MAY HAVE TO BE RECONFIGURED IN ORDER FOR ner.py TO WORK PROPERLY.
FOR EXAMPLE: the location of honorifics


More information on the code can be found in the docstrings in the ner.py file.
For analysis and description of the methods used, refer to the file entitled [Assignment1.pdf],
which contains a report.
